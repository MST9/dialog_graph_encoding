# dialog_graph_encoding
Creating dialog graph from dialog and then using Graph Attention Network for dialog encoding.

This work is my implementation of dialog encoding part of DialMed: A Dataset for Dialogue-based Medication Recommendation (https://github.com/Hhhhhhhzf/DialMed). I have translated some chinese text to english for my own understanding purpose.

I have also used dataset from https://github.com/Hhhhhhhzf/DialMed and translated them in english.
